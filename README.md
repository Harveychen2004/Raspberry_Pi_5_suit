## Activation Step:

1. Burn the system image onto the TF card and insert it into the mainboard.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to a display screen and power it on.
3. Upon booting up, connect to the network and enable I2C, VNC, and SSH functionalities through the menu bar.
4. Access the Raspberry Pi's IP address from the router's backend or use MobaXTerm.
5. Use an SSH client (MobaXTerm) to transfer files using the IP address.
6. Launch files remotely using JupyterLab
